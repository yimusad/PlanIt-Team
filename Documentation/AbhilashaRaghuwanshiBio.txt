Hi, my name is Abhilasha Raghuwanshi.
I am a pre-junior at Drexel University majoring in Data Science with a minor in Biological Science.
I enjoy gardening and plant care, and am learing how to oil paint recently.
I am working on the project "Planit" which is a web application to help create a custom planner.
