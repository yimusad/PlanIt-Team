                <p>
					 Yara is a Sudanese student currently attending Drexel University's College of Computing
                    Informatics.
                    She’s a second-year Data Science major with a minor in Software Engineering.
                    Her main goal is to combine her passion for AI and Machine Learning with medicine in order to
                    enhance the process of diagnosing diseases and developing treatments for them.
                    She also enjoys learning full-stack web development technologies. In her free time, she enjoys
                    reading and trying out new recipes. Yara decided to work on this project because she enjoys using planners to keep her
                    life on track and yet, she hasn't been able to find the perfect planner that fist all of her needs.
                    PlanIt seemed like the perfect opportunity for her to try and amend that. She hopes our users are able to seemlessly
                    create customized planners unqiue to them and that they help them stay on track!
